# feature-request
A web application that allows the user to create "feature requests".

== Steps to install and run this feature request app ==

The app was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS Linux utilizing Python
virtualenv based on Python 3.5.2.  Newer versions should work just fine.
When I get a chance I'll try this on a Windows machine and update this README.

Make a new directory and clone the repository.

    ~$ mkdir fapp
    ~$ cd fapp/
    ~/fapp$ git clone git@github.com:brucev3/feature-request.git

Create a Python virtual environment at the root of the project.

    ~/fapp$ cd feature-request/
    ~/fapp/feature-request$ which virtualenv

        No virtualenv?

    ~/fapp/feature-request$  ~/fapp/feature-request$ sudo apt install virtualenv
    ~/fapp/feature-request$ which virtualenv
    /usr/local/bin/virtualenv
    ~/fapp/feature-request$ virtualenv venv
    Using base prefix '/usr'
    New python executable in /home/bdv/fapp/feature-request/venv/bin/python3.5
    Also creating executable in /home/bdv/fapp/feature-request/venv/bin/python
    Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.

Activate the virtual environment.

    ~/fapp/feature-request$ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) ~/fapp/feature-request$

Install additional Python modules in the virtual environment the app needs.

    (venv) ~/fapp/feature-request$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app.

    (venv) ~/fapp/feature-request$ python run.py
    /home/bdv/fapp/feature-request/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/flask_sqlalchemy/__init__.py:794: FSADeprecationWarning: SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS adds significant overhead and will be disabled by default in the future.  Set it to True or False to suppress this warning.

You can see app is available at http://127.0.0.1:5002/ point your browser there.

Ctrl + c will kill the app.

    ^C(venv) ~/fapp/feature-request$

Deactivate the virtual environment.

    (venv) ~/fapp/feature-request$ deactivate
    ~/fapp/feature-request$

You may want to delete the database.

    ~/fapp/feature-request$ rm my_app/features.db
