    Is a Python web framework built with a small core
    and easy-to-extend philosophy.
    Flask is considered more Pythonic than the Django web framework because in
    common situations the equivalent Flask web application is more explicit.
    Flask is also easy to get started with as a beginner because there is
    little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.

SQLAlchemy

https://www.fullstackpython.com/sqlalchemy.html

    Is a well-regarded database toolkit and object-relational mapper (ORM)
    implementation written in Python. SQLAlchemy provides a generalized
    interface for creating and executing database-agnostic code without
    needing to write SQL statements.


What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/667781/what-is-the-difference-between-mvc-and-mvvm

    In MVC,the controller chooses the view(ex. web server). After the view is
    chosen, the view's state isn't connected to the controller. MVVM, the
    state of the view is continuously connected to the ViewModel(has some
    features similar to the controller). Think WPF/datacontext.

    MVVM - Model–view–viewmodel
    Use in situations where binding via a datacontext is possible.
    Why?
    The various IView interfaces for each view are removed which
    means less code to maintain. Some examples where MVVM is possible
    include WPF and javascript projects using Knockout.js

What is the DAO object model?

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa266932(v=vs.60).aspx

    The DAO object model is a collection of objects that model the structure
    of a relational database system. With the properties and methods provided
    by DAO objects, you can accomplish all of the operations necessary to
    manage such a system, including facilities for creating databases, defining
    tables, fields, and indexes, establishing relations between tables, and
    navigating and querying the database.
