What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/667781/what-is-the-difference-between-mvc-and-mvvm

    In MVC,the controller chooses the view(ex. web server). After the view is chosen, the view's state isn't connected to the controller. MVVM, the state of the view is continuously connected to the ViewModel(has some features similar to the controller). Think WPF/datacontext. There is actually more to it than that.

    The DAO object model is a collection of objects that model the structure of a relational database system. With the properties and methods provided by DAO objects, you can accomplish all of the operations necessary to manage such a system, including facilities for creating databases, defining tables, fields, and indexes, establishing relations between tables, and navigating and querying the database.
